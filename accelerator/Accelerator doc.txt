Official LiteX Resources
1. LiteX Wiki (Limited but useful)
Main Wiki: https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki
For Hardware Engineers: https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/LiteX-for-Hardware-Engineers
Covers basic module integration
CSR registers
Interrupts
Bus architecture
2. LiteX Source Code (Best documentation!)
The source code itself is the most reliable documentation:
litex/soc/integration/soc.py - Shows how dma_bus is created
litex/soc/cores/dma.py - DMA controller implementations
litex/soc/cores/usb_ohci.py - USB OHCI with DMA (great example!)
litex/soc/cores/video.py - Video framebuffer with DMA
3. LiteX-Boards Repository (Real Examples)
https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards
We've already looked at several examples:
digilent_nexys_video.py - USB OHCI DMA
sqrl_acorn.py - PCIe DMA
Multiple boards with video DMA
